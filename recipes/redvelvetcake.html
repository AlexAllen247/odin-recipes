    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 175 degrees C.</li>
        <li>Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together. Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in oven for about 30 minutes. If you place a toothpick into the center and it comes out clean, you're good to go. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Place on a serving plate and let it cool for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>To create the icing: heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
    </ol>
